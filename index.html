                On 9th April of the year 1989, massive demonstrations were held in Tbilisi, Georgia. Georgians requested independence from the communist Soviet Union. Although it was peaceful protests, soviet tanks entered the streets of Tbilisi and directly targeted civilians. Many people, even school students got killed and countless got injured, as they were fighting for freedom from the Soviet Union. Soviet Army used tear gasses, guns, and even tanks to kill people, but Georgians didn't give up and still fought.

                On the second anniversary of April 9, 1989, the Supreme Council of Georgia, under the leadership of Zviad Gamsakhurdia, adopted the Act of Independence of Georgia. April 9 was recorded in the history of Georgia as a day of tragedy and at the same time the restoration of Georgia's independence. Although Georgia is an independent country today, Russian occupation continues to this day, and more than 20% of Georgian territories (Abkhazia and Samachablo) are occupied by Russia.
